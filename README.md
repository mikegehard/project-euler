#Background

This repo is home to my attempts to solve the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems in four different programming languages:
  
  * Ruby
  * CoffeeScript
  * Scala
  * Clojure
  
# Goal

My goal is to use this as a way to ramp up my skills in CoffeeScript, Scala and Clojure. It will also allow me to try out some new ways of developing software, like using MiniTest::Spec over RSpec and Vim over RubyMine, at least for Ruby.

# Methodology

Ruby will be used as the language to fully understand the problems first. I will then work to solve the problems in each of the other three languages using TDD if possible.

I am also going to use MiniTest::Spec as the Ruby testing library to force myself to use something other than RSpec, my go to Ruby testing framework.
